# Week 0: Scratch #

- Base-2: binary system used in counting and other operations. 
- Binary Digit: 2 possible digits, 0 or 1, aka a "bit".
- Bit: simplest form of computer communication, giving in 0's and 1's.
- Bytes: a collection of bits to provide more detailed information retention. 
    - 8 bits = 1 byte.
      128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 --> Base-2 Binary System
    -  0  0  0  0  0 0 0 0 --> 8 bits = 1 byte

- Alphabet Letters: Characters or letters are given a disctinct binary "code" assinged to represent the character. 
    - ASCII: American Standard Code...
    - 8 bits or 1 byte make up the "code" for each character.
    - 128 characters make up ASCII

- UNICODE: Unicode is an international character encoding standard that provides a unique number for every character across languages and scripts.
    - Uses more bytes than ASCII to represent far more characters/symbols in language and emoticons. (Asian languages etc.)
    - Has 8 bit versions (2^8), 16 bit versions (2^16), and even 32 bit versions (2^32).

- RBG: Red, Blue, Green. A byte can correspond to a shade of either red, blue, or green. A computer can blend these bytes together to get different shades and colors. "Color Channels". 
    - Each shade or RBG/byte can count up to 256 bits
    - 256x256x256 = 16 million color/light strips

- Videos: a collection of images displayed at a certain rate of speed to convey the illusion of motion to the user/viewer.

- Music/Sound: Bytes can house information regarding pitch, key, duration, and even instrument type. The computer can combine these bytes of information together to process a musical note or sound. 

- Algorithm: step-by-step instructions for solving some problem. 
    - Precision
    - Take time to perform over some input of data. 
    - Correctness
    - Efficiency

- Pseudocode: Bare english instructions for completing some task or algorithm. Can be converted into code.

- Functions: perform a certain task that can be called upon again and again if needed.
    - Side-effects: functions can output some resulting data or information like printing to the screen or calling another function, etc. 
- Conditionals: if, elif, else statments to verify status of data.
- Boolean: an expression that returns either True or False.
- Loops: Actions performed

- Neural Networks: use of statistics and probability to produce an answer to a given question via a mass amount of data provided. 

- C Programming Language:
    - Fast
    - Devices run quickly
