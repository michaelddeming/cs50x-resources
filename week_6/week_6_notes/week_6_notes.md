# Week 6: Python #

- Functions: Python has functions just like in C.
    - Example:
        `print("hello, world")` 
            - No semicolons
            - No "\n" for newlines after strings, built into the print() function.
    - len(): length of a list

- Libraries: aka Modules or Packages in Python
    - Example:
        - `import cs50`
        - `from cs50 import x`-> will import a specific function or object from the cs50 module.

- Positional Parameters: The order of inputs to a function as parameters.

- Named Parameters: Explicitly declaring the parameters despite the functions definition.
    - Example:
        - `print("hello, world", end="!")`

- Types: Python has data types, not as many as C.
    - bool
    - float
    - int
    - strs
    - ...

- Data Structures:
    - range
    - list
    - tuple
    - dict
    - set

- Conditionals
    - Example:
        -   ````
            if x < y:
                print("x is less than y")
            ````
        - if, elif, else

- Object Oriented Programming: Python allows for creating objects where you are able to mimic structs but apply functionality to the object struct via classes.

- Methods: Functions that are applied to an object itself, if applicable, chaning the state in place. 

- Loops: 
    - range() can be used to get access to a range of vals starting from 0 by default.
        - Example: 

- Truncation: 

- Exceptions:
